            <h1>Early history of the lighthouse</h1>
            <p>
                The 23m lighthouse was designed by David Alan Stevenson for the Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB).
                Construction, between 1895 and 1899, was undertaken by George Lawson of Rutherglen at a cost of £1,899 (equivilent to £277,066 in 2023) which included the building, landing places, stairs, and railway tracks.
                All of the materials used had to be hauled up the 45m cliffs directly from supply boats.<br>
                A further £3,526 (£514,447 in 2023) was spent on the shore station at Breasclete on the Isle of Lewis.<br>
                The lighthouse was first lit on the 7th of December 1899.
            </p>

            <h1 class="mt-4">Transport</h1>
            <p>
                A cable-hauled railway was built to facilitate the transport of provisions up the steep gradients from the landing places.
                At that time, the light consumed twenty barrels of paraffin a year.
                The cable was powered by a small steam engine in a shed adjoining the lighthouse.
                The rail line descended from the lighthouse in a westerly direction and then curved round to the south.
                In the approximate centre of the island it forked by means of a set of hand-operated points dubbed "Clapham Junction", in reference to a railway junction in London; one branch continued in its curvature to head eastwards to the east landing place, on the south-east corner of the island, thus forming a half-circle, while the other, slightly shorter, branch curved back to the west to serve the west landing, situated in a small inlet on the island's south coast.
                The final approaches to the landing stages were extremely steep.
                The cable was guided round the curves by pulleys set between the rails, and a line of posts set outside the inner rail prevented it from going too far astray should it jump off the pulleys.
                The cargo was carried in a small four-wheeled bogie.<br><br>
                In the 1960s, the island's transport system was modernised.
                The railway was removed, leaving behind the concrete bed on which it had been laid to serve as a roadway for a "Gnat" – a three-wheeled, rubber-tyred cross-country vehicle powered by a 400-cubic-centimetre four-stroke engine, built by Aimers McLean of Galashiels.
                This had a somewhat shorter working life than the railway, becoming redundant in its turn when the helipad was constructed.
            </p>
            <h1 class="mt-4">Communication, automation, and other facts</h1>
            <p>
                In 1925, the lighthouse became one of the first Scottish lights to receive communications from the shore by wireless telegraphy.<br><br>
                On 28 September 1971, the lighthouse was automated. A reinforced concrete helipad was constructed at the same time to enable maintenance visits in heavy weather.
                The light is produced by burning acetylene gas and has a range of 17 nautical miles (20 mi; 31 km).
                It is now monitored from the Butt of Lewis and the shore station has been converted into flats.
