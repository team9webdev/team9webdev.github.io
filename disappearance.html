                    <p class="card-text">
                        The Flannan Isles Lighthouse, operational since December 1899, became the center of an enduring mystery just one year later.
                        In December 1900, the lighthouse keepers James Ducat, Thomas Marshall, and Donald McArthur vanished without explanation, leaving behind a haunting scene that continues to captivate and confound researchers and enthusiasts alike.
                        The circumstances surrounding their disappearance have inspired countless theories and remain one of Scotland's most perplexing maritime mysteries.

                        <li>One set of oilskins was missing, suggesting that one of the keepers had ventured out into the inclement weather without proper protection.</li>

                    <h1 class="card-title">The Official Investigation and Conclusion</h1>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The Northern Lighthouse Board conducted an investigation led by Superintendent Robert Muirhead.
                        The official conclusion was that the keepers had been swept away by a rogue wave while attempting to secure equipment near the west landing stage.
                        However, this explanation has been widely debated due to several inconsistencies and unanswered questions.
