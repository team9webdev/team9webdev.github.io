                    <p class="card-text">The Flannan Isles Lighthouse has long been a muse for creative expression. Its remote setting and haunting history have inspired a wide range of artistic interpretations. Painters are drawn to its desolate beauty, often depicting the stormy seas and dramatic cliffs in moody tones. Photographers capture the eerie silence of the site, juxtaposing the stark white tower against the ever-changing sky. Writers and poets have found fertile ground in the mystery of the missing keepers, turning their story into verse, fiction, and screenplays. The site continues to influence modern artists who explore themes of isolation, the sublime power of nature, and the fragile line between reality and myth.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Few places in the British Isles carry a cultural weight as strange and compelling as the Flannan Isles Lighthouse. Isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and shrouded in wind and fog, this lonely structure has become a touchstone of Scottish maritime identity, folklore, and superstition. The lighthouse gained international notoriety in 1900 when three keepers vanished without explanation—leaving behind a set dinner table, an untouched logbook, and a legacy of unanswered questions. That mystery has fueled over a century of speculation, becoming part of Scotland’s collective memory and storytelling tradition.
                    Even before the lighthouse was built, the Flannan Isles were steeped in spiritual and mythological lore. Named after Saint Flannan, a 7th-century Irish missionary, the islands were believed to be haunted or sacred—inhabited by ancient monks, lost souls, or elemental forces. These beliefs have lingered in local culture, passed through generations in tales of eerie lights, strange sounds, and a sense of the otherworldly that surrounds the isles.
                    Today, the cultural impact of the Flannan Isles Lighthouse can be seen in literature, theatre, visual art, film, and even music. It symbolizes the eternal human confrontation with the unknown: a beacon built to protect, standing guard in a place where protection ultimately failed. It serves as a reminder of nature’s indifference, human vulnerability, and the deep-rooted pull of mystery. Whether seen as a monument to resilience or a ghost story carved in stone, the lighthouse continues to fascinate and inspire all who hear its tale.</p>
